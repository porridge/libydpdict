libydpdict (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - The API and ABI have both changed in an incompatible way. This is
    expected to be the last such incompatible change, and it prepares ground
    to keep backwards compatibility on future API changes.
    - There are also some XHTML output bugfixes. (Closes: #446499)
  * Changing the name of the -dev package to signify API breakage.
  * Made updates necessary for the ABI version bump
    - changed the main package name to libydpdict2
    - changed filenames to include "2"
  * Changed Source-Version to binary:Version as dictated by the new policy
  * Moved the Homepage: from the long descriptions to a header, which is now
    supported by dpkg
  * Added a symbols file
  * Bumped standards-version to 3.7.3
  * Corrected the -dev package's section to be contrib/libdevel
  * Fixed the clean target to only invoke distclean when the Makefile exists,
    rather than ignoring distclean's exit status, thanks lintian
